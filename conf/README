The RiotFamily Configuration System
===================================

A project can be configured differently for various target environments. 

By default there are two targets: "development" and "live". You can add
additional targets by simply adding further directories to the /conf folder.

Each target can be customized for different profiles. If for example a developer
wants to use a different database but otherwise stick to the default values, 
he can create a subdirectory in the "development" folder and place a properties 
file there.  

Lets say Joe wants to override the jdbc.url property defined in the 
application.properties. All he has to do is to create the file 
/conf/development/joe/application.properties (relative to the project root)
and put a single line in there, for example:

jdbc.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test

When he now invokes one of the project's Ant targets, the default 
application.properties file will be merged with the one he just created.


An explicit target (and profile) can be specified on the command line:

#> ant -Dtarget=development -Dprofile=joe webapp

If omitted, the target will default to "development" and the profile will be
set to the current username.
